# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# React 시작하기

[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)를 참고하여 만들어졌어요.

## 제공되는 스립트

프로젝트 디렉토리에서 실행할 수 있는 것들:

### `npm start`

development mode로 코드를 실행함.\
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)를 브라우저로 열면 개발중인 웹페이지를 볼 수 있어요.

코드를 수정하면 웹페이지에서도 업데이트 됐어요.\
콘솔에서 lint error도 볼 수 있어요.

### `npm test`

test runner를 interactive watch mode로 실행함.\
자세한 정보는 [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) 참고.

### `npm run build`

`build` 폴더에 production을 위해 앱을 빌드함.\
React를 production mode로 번들해주며 성능을 위해 build를 최적화 해줌.

build는 minified(불필요한 부분을 삭제함) 되고 파일 이름에 hash가 추가됨.\
인제 앱이 deploy된 준비가 끝남!

자세한 정보는 [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) 참고.
